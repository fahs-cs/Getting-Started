# Getting Started With Github

## Set Up Your Account
Much like any other website, in order to get the most out of Github, you must have a Github account. Luckily, the process for creating one is very simple. 

Start by going to `github.com/join` or by pressing right [here](https://github.com/join).
From there, follow the instructions on the page by filling out the required fields.

`WARNING: I recommend not using your school email. It will be deleted eventually!`

Then push create account, continue to the next page. Choose free (or paid if you really want to).
Finally, fill out the 'Tailor your experience' section.

## Hello, World!
Before beging to talk about how Github works, you may want to know its vocabulary. Ready?!

- Repository (Repo): A digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves

Bam! Done.

Not really of course. However, that's really all you need to know about at the moment. If you want to learn more about Github & Git, I recommend watching this fantastic short series of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) by Daniel Shiffman.

Now that you know what a repository is, let's make one! Go to the `github.com/fahs-cs/` and enter the `repositories` section. From there you should see a green button in the upper right brandishing the label `New`. Push that button. Once you enter the "Create a new repository" screen, leave the owner drop down selected on fahs-cs. Next, fill out the `Repository name` and write a breif description in the `Description` section. Leave the privacy setting on public. Check the box labeled `Initialize this repository with a README`. Then press the `Create repository` button.

Alright, you know have your very own repository. The interface may look a little complicated, however, the few things that matter are the `Create new file`, `Upload files`, and `Clone or download` buttons. Additionally, you will see a list containing a single [README.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) element. I recommend editing this file to reflect your project's details, however, you can do this later. For now, locate all of the files which make up your project. Then press the `Upload files` and drag them onto the page, or choose your files through the file system. Then, in the `Commit changes` section add a title and description to your new "__commit__". Finally, press the green `Commit changes` button. There you have it, you've *commited* to your first repository. Now with any new update you may make to your project, do the same process, but only add the files you changed (or all doesn't really matter).

## Working with others

A big part of the Github experience is found when working together with other people. Fortunatly, our organization facilitates this very easily. Once you have a respository all set up, navigate to the `settings` tab at the top right of the main repository page. Then, select `Collaborators & teams` from the left navigation bar. Within this subset of settings, you can invite collaborators to your project, create a new team, or add a pre-existing team. For more information about how teams work and what they provide check out Github's fantastic [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/organizing-members-into-teams). To add a collaborator to your project, simply scroll down to the box titled `Collaborators`, type in the name of the user you want to invite, and press `Add collaborator`. From there, you can assign permissions for each member you add. In the list within the box titled `Collaborators`, press the drop down next to the user you would like to change permissions for, then pick the premission you'd like. Find more about permissions and what they entail [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization).

## Finding out more

Another good thing about Github is the endepth documentation which they provide. If you have any questions about anything regarding Github you can most likely find an answer within their help [articles](https://help.github.com/en). Alternativly, you can take to the vast community surrounding Github in the [community section](https://github.community/). If you're still stuck, ask around within our organization's team group [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/fahs-cs/teams) to see if anyone has stumble upon the same issue.



Happy Github-ing,
